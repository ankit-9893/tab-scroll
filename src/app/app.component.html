                >Section 2: What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of
                the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
                It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
                Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader
                will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
                its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
                more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
                'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
                Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem
                Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'
                will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions
                have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
                purpose (injected humour and the like). What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem
